# Quant Journey 🚀

A personal journey to master **Quantitative Research & Trading** — building the mindset, math intuition, and coding rigor required by top firms.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Strengthen probability, statistics, and problem-solving under pressure  
- Build strong proficiency in OCaml and Python  
- Develop simulation projects (order book, Monte Carlo, etc.)  
- Prepare for quantitative trading interviews (math, logic, code)

## 🧩 Structure

| Folder | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| `01-maths-probability/` | Math foundations: probability puzzles, linear algebra, and statistics |
| `02-programming/` | OCaml & Python training, with LeetCode tracking |
| `03-simulations/` | Practical simulations: order book, random processes, Monte Carlo |
| `04-trading-strategy/` | Small trading experiments, strategy prototypes, and research notes |
| `docs/` | Goals, roadmap, and resources tracking progress |

## 📅 Timeline

- **Phase 1 (Month 1-2):** OCaml basics + probability puzzles + LeetCode training  
- **Phase 2 (Month 3-4):** Order book simulation + stochastic modeling  
- **Phase 3 (Month 5-6):** Interview prep + strategy prototypes  

Details in [`docs/timeline.md`](docs/timeline.md)

## 🧠 Guiding Principle

> “Think probabilistically. Code precisely. Execute consistently.”
